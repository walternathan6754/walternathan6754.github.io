additional_comments: We have implemented the ST2 water model into <strong><a href="http://www.gromacs.org/" style="color:#455C7B"> GROMACS </a></strong>, an open source molecular dynamics package.  The code has been fully parallelized for efficiency, and has been benchmarked with the original work by Stillinger on <strong><a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/60/4/10.1063/1.1681229" style="color:#455C7B"> ST2 </a></strong>.  For information about the ST2 code or to request access to the ST2 code, please contact me.

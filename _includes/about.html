                    I am currently a graduate student at the <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a></strong> in the Department of Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering, pursuing my PhD.  I am working in <strong><a href="http://zhang.npre.illinois.edu/" style="color:#F57336"> Professor Zhang's </a></strong> research group, and have been a part of the group for almost three years.  Before graduate school, I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign also for my Bachelor's Degree in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering, which I completed in December of 2013, and before that, I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago.  In between my first and second year of graduate school, I attended the compuational physics summer school program at <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>Los Alamos National Labratory</a></strong> in New Mexico.  During that summer, I developed codes for a hyperelastic framework.  The following summer, I attended the X-ray and Neutron Scattering Summer School at Argonne and Oak Ridge National Labratories to learn about the use of scattering experiments.

                    During my graduate studies, I have mostly focused on material behavior out of equilibrium, studied primarly through atomic scale simulations and neutron scattering expirements.  From a compuational side, I have used both <strong><a style="color:#F57336">molecular dynamics</a></strong> (classical and <i>ab initio</i>) and <strong><a style="color:#F57336">Monte Carlo</a></strong> simulations to study materials, along with developing a <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>Metadynamics module</a></strong> for GROMACS.  Further, I implemented the <a  style="color:#F57336"><strong>ST2 water model</a></strong> into GROMACS for simulation.  I aided in the developement of a open source package, <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>LiquidLib</a></strong>, geared towards post-processing of atomic scale simulations.  From an experimental side, I have participated in several <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>Neutron Scattering Experiments</a></strong> at Oak Ridge National Labratory.  On the side, I have modeled the relationship between flexibility and porousity in organic cages, developed a <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>high dimensional</a></strong> (greater than 3) Lennard-Jones molecular dynamics package for dimensional studies of liquids, and used <a style="color:#F57336"><strong>machine learning</a></strong> to explore trends (in Steam User Data, Twitter, and the stock market).
